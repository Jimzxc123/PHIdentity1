          <h2>Bayanihan</h2>
          <p>Bayanihan is a Filipino custom that embodies the spirit of communal unity and cooperation, especially in times of need. The word "bayanihan" comes from the word "bayan", which means "town", "nation", or "community". The term literally means "being a bayan".</p>
          <p>The most iconic representation of Bayanihan is the tradition of neighbors helping a family move by carrying their house on their shoulders. This is done by placing long bamboo poles under the house and then carrying it to its new location. The moving family expresses their gratitude by hosting a small fiesta for everyone. </p>
          <p>Bayanihan can also refer to:</p>
          <p>- A system of mutual assistance where community members work together to accomplish a difficult task</p>
          <p>- A spirit of civic unity and cooperation among Filipinos</p>
          <p>- An ancient island custom</p>
          <p>Bayanihan is a deeply rooted Filipino cultural value that emphasizes community unity, cooperation, and the spirit of helping one another. The term itself originates from the Tagalog word bayan, which means "town" or "community." Traditionally, bayanihan refers to the practice of neighbors working together to achieve a common goal, often in the form of collective action or mutual aid.</p>
          <p>Historical Context of Bayanihan
            Historically, bayanihan was most famously depicted through the act of moving a bahay kubo (a traditional Filipino house made of bamboo and nipa palm) from one location to another. In rural areas, when a family decided to relocate their home, the entire village would help. The neighbors would lift the house together, using bamboo poles, and carry it to its new site. This practice showcased the community's solidarity and selflessness, as everyone would participate without expecting anything in return.</p>
