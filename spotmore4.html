          <p>Mayon Volcano is one of the most famous and active volcanoes in the Philippines. It is located in the province of Albay, in the Bicol region of Luzon, the largest island in the country. Known for its nearly perfect conical shape, Mayon is a symbol of natural beauty and power, attracting tourists and researchers alike. However, its beauty belies its potential for destructive eruptions.</p>
          <p>Type of Volcano: Mayon is a stratovolcano, which means it is a composite volcano built up by layers of hardened lava flows, tephra (volcanic ash, rocks, and debris), and pyroclastic material. Stratovolcanoes are typically steep-sided and are often associated with explosive eruptions.</p>
          <p>Height: Mayon stands at 2,463 meters (8,081 feet) above sea level, making it the highest peak in Bicol. Its symmetrical cone shape is a result of its consistent eruptions of relatively fluid lava, which allows it to maintain its steep, cone-like structure.</p>
          <p>Mayon is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, with over 50 recorded eruptions since its first recorded eruption in 1616. Some of its most significant eruptions have had widespread impacts on the local population and the environment.</p>
          <p>The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) closely monitors Mayon’s activity through seismic activity, gas emissions, and visual observations. The agency issues warnings when eruptions are imminent, and local governments conduct evacuations to protect residents in high-risk areas.</p>
          <p>The Mayon Volcano Natural Park, located around the volcano, is a designated area for conservation and also serves as a protected region for people living in the vicinity. This is done to ensure the balance between safety, conservation, and tourism.</p>
          <p>Given the risks of living near an active volcano, efforts have been made to manage the surrounding environment. The Mayon Volcano Natural Park is a protected area aimed at preserving the region’s biodiversity, including its rich forests, wildlife, and habitats. Local communities are also involved in sustainable farming practices to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture in the area.</p>
