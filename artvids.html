                    Philippine Art History spans a wide range of styles and periods, reflecting the nationâ€™s rich cultural heritage, colonial experiences, and artistic evolution. The history of art in the Philippines can be divided into several major periods, each marked by distinct influences and changes in artistic practices.

                    Before the arrival of Spanish colonizers, the indigenous people of the Philippines had already developed their own art forms, influenced by their beliefs, environment, and daily life. This art was mostly functional and spiritual. The American period introduced Western education and new techniques in painting, sculpture, and other arts. Contemporary Filipino art is marked by a fusion of traditional and modern influences, often addressing social, political, and cultural issues.
