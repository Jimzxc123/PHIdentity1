          <h2>Kamayan</h2>
          <p>Kamayan is a traditional Filipino practice of eating with your hands, usually at a communal feast. Meaning: The word kamayan is Tagalog for "by hand".</p>
          <p>Origin: The tradition began in the Filipino military as a way to quickly feed troops. </p>
          <p>Food: A typical kamayan feast features a variety of Filipino dishes served on banana leaves, including rice, fish, meat, vegetables, and sauces. Diners use their hands to scoop up food and eat.</p>
          <p>Significance: Kamayan is a way to reconnect with Filipino cultural heritage, build trust, and foster a sense of pride and togetherness.</p>
          <p>History: Kamayan was a common practice before Spanish colonization, but was discouraged by the Spanish and American colonizers. Today, kamayan is enjoying a resurgence, especially in places with large Filipino immigrant populations.</p>
          <p>Other names: In Visayan languages, kamayan is also known as kinamot or kinamut.</p>
          <p>Kamayan is a Filipino cultural term for the various occasions or contexts in which pagkakamay (Tagalog: "[eating] with the hands") is practiced, including as part of communal feasting (called salu-salo in Tagalog). Such feasts traditionally served the food on large leaves such as banana or breadfruit spread on a table, with the diners eating from their own plates. The practice is also known as kinamot or kinamut in Visayan languages. While kamayan started out as a common folkway before the arrival of European colonizers, its culturally significance has become elevated in the Philippines' postcolonial culture, since the practice of pagkakamay had been discouraged by the Philippines' Spanish and American colonizers.
            A separate tradition which involves eating with the hands straight off the table is the boodle fight, a tradition of the Armed Forces of the Philippines originally practiced by Philippine Military Academy cadets, and drawn from a similar tradition at the United States Military Academy West Point. The intent is to build military camaraderie by getting military personnel to enjoy the same food together, regardless of rank.
            Among restaurants outside of the Philippines, however, the term "boodle fight" has often been conflated with "kamayan" and "salo-salo," and the terms tend to be used synonymously when marketing the Filipino food experience.</p>
