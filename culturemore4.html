          <h2>Harana</h2>
          <p>Harana was a traditional form of courtship in the Philippines wherein men introduced themselves and/or wooed women by singing underneath her window at night. It was widely practiced in old Philippines with a set of protocols, a code of conduct and a specific style of music. Harana is a traditional Filipino courtship practice where a man serenades a woman at night to express his admiration:</p>
          <p>What it is - 
            Harana is a type of love song and a social event where a man sings a love song to a woman at her window or outside her house. The man is accompanied by his friends, who play instruments, and the event takes place at night to avoid the heat. </p>
          <p>How it's done - 
            The man sings a song he wrote or about his love for the woman. The guitar is the most common instrument used. The melody is smooth and flowing, with dramatic intervals.</p>
          <p>Why it's done - 
            Harana is a way for the man to express his admiration to the woman and her family and neighbors. It's a way to be vulnerable and express feelings that society might not allow to be expressed outwardly. </p>
          <p>Harana is a traditional Filipino form of courtship, which involves a man serenading a woman to express his love and affection. It is a deeply rooted cultural practice, often associated with romantic gestures and respectful admiration, reflecting the values of Filipino courtship, which emphasize sincerity, respect, and patience.</p>
          <br></br>
          <h2>Origins and Meaning</h2>
          <p>The word "harana" comes from the Spanish word "serenata," which refers to a serenade, a musical gesture typically performed outside someone's window or door, often in the evening. The practice has its origins in Spanish colonial times, where Spanish influence brought the tradition of serenading to the Philippines. However, the Filipino version of harana has evolved to have its own unique characteristics, and it remains an iconic part of Filipino romance and courtship.</p>
          <p>While harana is less common in modern-day courtship—especially with the rise of digital communication and more direct forms of dating—there are still instances where this practice is celebrated. In some rural areas, harana remains a popular and respectful form of expressing affection. Additionally, in urban settings or among younger generations, it may be seen as a nostalgic or romantic gesture that invokes a sense of cultural pride.</p>
